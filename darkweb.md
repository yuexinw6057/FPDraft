<p> To put it in simpiler phrase: </p>
<ul> 
    <li>the surface web is the place where many people like you and me go. It is one of the best places to go to when you are bored at home. 
Either doing your work or just chilling. </li>
    <li> <i> The deep web is different from the Dark web! </i> People get it confused all the time! One of them is me. But it is completely different!
    The deep web like the picture mentioned is a place where <b> YOUR </b> information may be stored <b> <i> legally </i> </b> like it mentioned above.</li>
    <li> Now the final tip of the ice berg is a place where you don't want to be. The <i> Dark Web. </i> This place is full of illegal activities 
    and trafficking. The only way to get there if you have a website that secures your access to it. Web browsers like Tor allows you to access with 
    no difficulties. </li>
</ul> 

<h4> <b> Dark Fact! </b> : <i> Dark web website addresses end with .onion instead of the surface webâ€™s .com, .org, or .gov. They use something call the 
onion router so that they don't get tracked with anything. Especially the IP addresses. </i> </h4>
