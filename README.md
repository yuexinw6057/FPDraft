### WHO?
<p> You might be wondering who is this person writing this own blog on the darkweb. In fact you should all be asking that question. I am a student
at Tele who is in SEP class who has a very deep interest in studying how the computers work. It wouldn't be as good to read other things as mine because
this is written with 99.99% true info. Therefore, enjoy your *darkweb journey* ! </p> <br>

### WHAT?
<p> Now that I have hooked you in, what is the dark web? The darkweb is a mysterious place where people manage to access for their own entertainment. 
I would like to say that a lot of it is very disturbing and just _f*^!_ up to see. Because of that, I am here to warn you and give you a tiny 
idea of what it is. </p> <br>
